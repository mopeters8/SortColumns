Lab Assignment 3
Owen Peters - 9/18/2020

I was able to complete the lab assignment, and every example in the assignment ran accordingly.
I feel as if my code may be a bit sloppy in areas, so any critique would be greatly appreciated if youre allowed to do that,
but it gets the job done.

Asymptotic Runtime
My guess would be O(n log n), since my code has two for loops, and each loop
I am checking an array N spots in the array, N times. Runtime is still a little confusing. 

Space Complexity
O(n), since I delcare an array of size N.
